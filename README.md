Natural Clustering of Discourse–Pragmatic Functions of Look
This repository investigates whether natural clusters emerge for different discourse–pragmatic functions of the English lexical item look when using density-based unsupervised clustering.
Rather than imposing a fixed number of clusters, the project applies HDBSCAN, which discovers clusters of varying density and identifies outliers.
The analysis focuses on three functions:
Interjection (INTJ)
Directive (DIR)
Discourse Marker (DM)
The dataset contains both attested (real) and augmented samples, enabling analysis of how augmentation affects cluster formation.
